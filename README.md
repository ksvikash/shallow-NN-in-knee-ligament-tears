## Abstract
This study explores the transformative impact of deep learning on knee injury detection, specifically focusing on anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) tear identification within MRI scans using a shallow 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model. 
Leveraging the MRNet dataset encompassing 1370 knee MRI scans, our approach employs deep learning techniques for binary 
classification of ACL injuries. With a remarkable balanced accuracy of 88%, our shallow 3D CNN model effectively discerns the 
presence or absence of ACL tears. This research underscores the paradigm shift brought by deep learning in automated ACL tear 
detection, showcasing its capacity to revolutionize orthopedic imaging. By harnessing the power of intricate three-dimensional MRI 
data, this work exemplifies how deep learning methodologies have significantly enhanced and transformed knee injury assessment, 
promising improved clinical decision support systems in orthopedic diagnostics.
